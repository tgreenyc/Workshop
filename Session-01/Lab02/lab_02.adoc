= Lab 2 - Binding to Cloud Foundry Services

[abstract]
--
In this lab, we'll be binding a MySQL database service to the application we pushed earlier and then view the configuration data Cloud Foundry provides to the application as a result.
In a future lab we will see how easy it is to use Steeltoe Connectors to make use of the MySql service in your application

Cloud Foundry services are managed through two primary types of operations:

Create/Delete:: These operations create or delete instances of a service.
For a database this could mean creating/deleting a schema in an existing multitenant cluster or creating/deleting a dedicated database cluster.
Bind/Unbind:: These operations create or delete unique credential sets for an existing service instance that can then be injected into the environment of an application instance.

== A Bit of Review

If your instance of the sample _env_ is not running after the steps completed in lab 1.  Make sure to follow the instructions in lab01 to deploy the application again.

After you have the application deployed and started, visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was assigned to it.  Select the ``CloudFoundry Config`` menu item and notice the application shows there aren't any Cloud Foundry Services listed.  Let's change that.

== The Services Marketplace

There are two ways to discover what services are available on Pivotal Cloudfoundry.
The first is available on any instance of Cloud Foundry: the CLI. Just type:

----
> cf marketplace
----

and you'll get a list of services, their available plans, and descriptions. On Pivotal Cloudfoundry, the ``free`` tier of plans is normally the first one listed.

The second way is specific to Pivotal Cloudfoundry's Apps Manager UI.
If you haven't already, login to it by visiting https://apps.run.haas-69.pez.pivotal.io or the appropriate link for your workshop setup.

Click on the ''Marketplace'' link:

and you'll see the same service/plan/description listing in the browser:

== Creating and Binding to a Service Instance

. Let's begin by creating a MySQL service instance.
From the Apps Manager UI service marketplace, select _MySQL_, select the free plan, and provide an instance name.
In the drop-down list next to _Bind to App_ select your workshop application.

. Notice the admonition to `Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect`.
Let's take a look at the environment variables for our application. We can do this by viewing to the homepage of the application.
Here we will see a printout of the environment information.  Take note of what is contained in the section _Bound Services_.  It's an empty JSON document!

. Now let's _restage_ the application, which cycles our application back through the staging/buildpack process before redeploying the application.footnote:[In this case, we could accomplish the same goal by only _restarting_ the application via `cf restart env`.
A _restage_ is generally recommended because Cloud Foundry buildpacks also have access to injected environment variables and can install or configure things differently based on their values.]
+
----
> cf restage env
----
+
Once the application is running again, revisit or refresh the browser tab where you have the _Wokshop_ application loaded.  You'll notice now we have information that could be used to connect to the MySQL DB.
In fact, data can now be stored/retrieved into/from that MySQL database!

Bound Services:
 {
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
      "p-mysql": [
        {
          "credentials": {
            "hostname": "192.168.1.46",

          },
          "syslog_drain_url": null,
          "volume_mounts": [],
          "label": "p-mysql",
          "provider": null,
          "plan": "100mb",
          "name": "mysql",
          "tags": [
            "mysql",
            "relational"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

. You may also verify your service was provisioned in the Apps Manager UI by clicking on your application and selecting the _Services_ tab.
+
image::../../Common/images/lab-app-service.png[]
+
You should now see the service created in step 1 listed.

. You may also verify your service was provisioned using the CLI:
+
----
> cf services
----
+
. Now take a look at your app again. Click on the ``CloudFoundry Configuration`` menu item and you can see how the Steeltoe CloudFoundry configuration provider has parsed the ``VCAP_SERVICES`` and made the details available as configuration data.
+

{sp}+
Again take some time and see if you can find in the code how this is accomplished.
Start with the ``CloudFoundryConfig()`` action in the ``HomeController``.
